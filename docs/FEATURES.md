---

## AI / ML Integration

### Edge Function: `qc-ai-review` (v6, deployed)
Three actions routed through a single Supabase edge function:

1. **Confidence scoring** (`action: 'confidence'`) — Default action on task submission
   - Fetches task + submission data from DB
   - Calls ML API at `/api/v1/review/confidence`
   - Creates `qc_reviews` record (review_type='ai', weight=0)
   - Stores JSON feedback: `{summary, confidence_breakdown, issues, recommendations}`
   - Transitions task status to `under_review`
   - Falls back to p0=0.8 if ML unavailable

2. **Complexity analysis** (`action: 'complexity'`) — Used by TaskCreateModal "AI Suggest"
   - Calls ML API at `/api/v1/task/complexity`
   - Returns suggested story points + reasoning
   - No database write

3. **Quality assessment** (`action: 'quality'`) — Used by QC page on task select
   - Calls ML API at `/api/v1/review/quality/{task_id}`
   - Returns overall quality, strengths, areas of concern
   - No database write

### Frontend ML Client (`src/lib/services/ml.ts`)
- All requests proxied through edge function (credentials stay server-side)
- `mlApi.getSubmissionConfidence()` — Confidence scoring
- `mlApi.analyzeTaskComplexity()` — Story point suggestions
- `mlApi.getQualityAssessment()` — QC decision support
- Graceful fallback defaults on all methods

### QC Page AI Features (gated by `ai_qc_review` flag)
- AI confidence % badge in task queue list
- Confidence breakdown progress bars (completeness, quality, requirements met)
- Issues list with bullet points
- Recommendations list
- Quality assessment panel with strengths/concerns
- Comparison to similar tasks percentile

### TaskCreateModal AI Feature
- "AI Suggest" button for story points (gated by `ai_qc_review` flag)
- Displays reasoning from ML complexity analysis

### ML Model Deployed and Live
- FastAPI service running at `https://orbitqcml.onrender.com` (Render, Docker)
- `ML_API_URL` and `ML_API_KEY` Supabase secrets set; edge function returns real confidence scores
- 3 endpoints: `/api/v1/review/confidence` (default), `/api/v1/task/complexity`, `/api/v1/review/quality/{task_id}`
- Edge function falls back to p0=0.8 if ML API unreachable
- Deployment reference: `docs/ML_MODEL_HOSTING.md`

---

## QC Review System

### Shapley Value Calculations (`src/lib/utils/payout.ts`)
- First-pass marginal: `d_1 = β * p_0 * V`
- Geometric decay: `d_k = d_1 * γ^(k-1)`
- Budget normalization when marginals exceed task value
- Expected QC contribution formula
- Effective sample size for weighted reviews
- Pass number correctly excludes AI reviews (human pass 1 = first human review)

### QC Review Page (`/qc`)
- Review queue with FIFO ordering (oldest first)
- Task detail panel with description, submission data, file attachments
- Previous reviews display (AI and human)
- Potential payout preview based on Shapley calculation
- Approve/reject with required feedback on rejection
- Route guard: only QC reviewers and admins

### Review Types & Weights
- AI review: weight=0 (informational only)
- Peer review: weight=1.0
- Independent review: weight=2.0

### Auto-Payout on Approval
- QC approval automatically creates payout records via `payoutsApi.create()`:
  - **Task payout** for assignee: `dollar_value * urgency_multiplier`
  - **QC payout** for reviewer: Shapley `d_k` value
- Both payouts run in parallel via `Promise.allSettled` — one failure doesn't block the other
- Payout status on creation depends on org setting:
  - `auto_approve_payouts = true` → status `paid`, `paid_at` stamped immediately
  - `auto_approve_payouts = false` → status `pending`, requires admin action in `/admin/payouts`
- Email notification sent to payout recipient (fire-and-forget)

---

## Payout System

### Employee Compensation
- Hybrid salary + task-based: `salary = base * r + task_value * (1 - r)`
- Configurable salary/task ratio (r) per employee
- Organization-level bounds on r (default: 0.5-0.9)
- Salary Mixer UI in settings page

### PM Profit Share
- `payout = (budget - spent) * X - overdraft * (penalty * X) + bonus`
- PM pickup bonus based on project wait time
- Overdraft penalty multiplier (default 1.5x)

### Sales Commission
- Base commission with decay over waiting period
- PM bonus contribution from unclaimed commission

### Payout Infrastructure
- `payoutsApi.create()` — Creates payout record with email notification (fire-and-forget)
- `payoutsApi.update(id, updates)` — Updates payout fields (status, paid_at); used by admin approval flow
- `payoutsApi.listAll(filters?)` — Admin-only; fetches all org payouts with joined user + task data
- `payoutsApi.listByUser(userId)` — Per-user payout history
- `payoutsApi.getSummary(userId, period)` — Aggregated totals by status and type
- Auto-creates task payout + QC reviewer payout on QC approval (`qcApi.create()`)
- Client-side calculation utilities in `payout.ts`

### RLS Policies (payouts table)
- `payouts_self_read` / `payouts_admin_read` — SELECT for owner and admin
- `payouts_insert_qc_admin` — INSERT for `qc` and `admin` roles within their org
- `payouts_update_admin` — UPDATE for `admin` role only within their org

### Payout Status Lifecycle
`pending` → `approved` → `paid` — all transitions are manual admin actions (no auto-promotion)
- **pending**: auto-set on QC approval
- **approved**: admin verified the amount
- **paid**: admin confirms transfer; `paid_at` stamped
- With `auto_approve_payouts` enabled: skips pending/approved, creates directly as `paid`

### Payout Tracking Page (`/payouts`)
- Type filter (task, qc, pm_bonus, sales_commission)
- Status filter (pending, approved, paid)
- Period-based summaries (week/month/year)
- Summary cards: Total Earned (paid only), Pending, Avg per Task
- Earnings by type breakdown with click-to-filter
- CSV export

### Admin Payout Management (`/admin/payouts`)
- Full org-wide payout table with recipient, role, task, type, amount, date, status
- Per-row actions: **Approve** (pending → approved), **Mark Paid** (→ paid, stamps paid_at)
- Bulk header actions: **Approve all pending**, **Mark all paid** (pending + approved)
- Summary cards: Pending total, Approved total, All-time paid total
- Filter tabs: All / Pending / Approved / Paid
- Auto-refresh button

---

## External Contractor Flow

### Assignment
- PM/Admin assigns task externally via `ExternalAssignmentModal`
- `assign_task_externally` RPC creates assignment + contract record
- Guest submission token generated for external access

### Contract E-Signature
- PDF generation via jsPDF client-side (`contractPdf.ts`) — no edge function needed
- Upload to Supabase Storage at `contracts/{org_id}/{contract_id}/{filename}.pdf`
- Dual-signature flow: Party A (employer) → Party B (contractor)
- External signing route: `/contract/[token]`
- Contract status: draft → pending_signature → active → completed

### Custom Contract Templates
- `contract_templates` table with RLS: org-scoped read for all roles, admin-only write
- Templates define sections (`{title, body, order}`) and variables (`{key, label, required, default}`)
- `{{variable}}` substitution rendered at PDF generation time
- `generateFromTemplate()` in `contractPdf.ts` — jsPDF layout with variable substitution
- `validateTemplateVariables()` — validates required variables before generation
- `contractTemplatesApi` — `list()`, `getById()`, `getDefault()`, `create()`, `update()`, `delete()`, `setDefault()`
- Admin UI: `/admin/contract-templates` — list view + `ContractTemplateEditor` component (sections, variables, inline token insert, reorder, default toggle)
- `contracts.template_id` FK — nullable for backwards compat with legacy task-based contracts
- `contracts/[id]` PDF generation: checks `template_id` first, falls back to legacy `generateContractorAgreement()`
- "New Contract" button on contracts page (admin/pm/sales) — template picker + variable fill-in form
- Org-level default template per type (unique partial index: `WHERE is_default = true`)

### Contracts Page PDF Loading
- Contract list loads PDFs directly from Storage bucket (source of truth)
- Lists `contracts/{org_id}/` folders → each folder is a contract ID
- Merges Storage file paths with DB records when accessible
- Falls back to storage-only entry if DB RLS blocks the record
- Supports View (inline iframe) and Download for all found PDFs

### External Submission
- Guest submission portal: `/submit/[token]`
- URL and GitHub PR artifact support (no file upload for guests)
- `submit_external_work` RPC handles submission
- Triggers AI QC review automatically (same as internal submissions)

- **Tables**: All data tables wrapped in `overflow-x-auto` for horizontal scroll
- **Modals**: Max-width with `mx-4` margin on mobile for consistent padding
- **Forms**: Full-width inputs, grid layouts collapse to single column on mobile

## Capacitor Native App

Native plugin layer at `src/lib/services/capacitor/` — all plugins no-op on web.

### Push Notifications (`@capacitor/push-notifications`)
- `initializePushNotifications(userId)` — requests permission, registers with FCM/APNs, stores device token in `users.metadata.push_token`
- `notifyDevice(userId, title, body, data?)` — calls `send-push` edge function → FCM HTTP API
- `supabase/functions/send-push/index.ts` — looks up push token, fires FCM; skips silently if `FCM_SERVER_KEY` not set
- Foreground notifications shown as in-app toasts; tapped notifications navigate via `data.route`
- Initialized from `(app)/+layout.svelte` after user loads

### Biometric Auth (`@aparajita/capacitor-biometric-auth` + `@capacitor/preferences`)
- `enrollBiometrics(session)` — stores Supabase session tokens in secure native storage after biometric confirmation
- `authenticateWithBiometrics()` — prompts Face ID / fingerprint; restores session via `supabase.auth.setSession()`; clears enrollment if tokens expired
- Login page: auto-attempts biometric on mount (if enrolled); offers enroll after successful password login
- `clearBiometricSession()` — removes tokens (called on sign out)

### File Access (`@capacitor/camera`)
- `pickFromCamera(source)` — opens camera or photo gallery; returns `File` blob
- `pickFileNative()` — opens native file picker (via `CameraSource.Files`)
- `FileUploadZone.svelte` — detects `isNative()` on mount; shows Camera / Gallery / Files buttons on native; drops through to standard drag-and-drop on web

### Deep Links (`@capacitor/app`)
- `initializeDeepLinks()` — handles cold-start URL and `appUrlOpen` events
- Routes `/contract/[token]`, `/submit/[token]`, `/auth/*` to SvelteKit `goto`
- `capacitor.config.ts` — `androidScheme: https`, `hostname: owenstuckman.lol`

### Build
- `npm run build:mobile` — `MOBILE_BUILD=true vite build && npx cap sync`
- Packages: `@capacitor/core`, `@capacitor/cli` (dev), `@capacitor/ios`, `@capacitor/android` (dev)
- `capacitor.config.ts` — appId `com.orbit.app`, webDir `build`
- **Remaining** (human): `npx cap add ios/android`, platform permissions in Info.plist / AndroidManifest, app icons, FCM server key secret, Supabase auth redirect URL

## Multi-Language Support (i18n)

### Infrastructure
- **Library**: `@inlang/paraglide-sveltekit` — compile-time i18n, zero runtime overhead, tree-shaken per locale
- `project.inlang/settings.json` configures source language (`en`) and supported tags (`en`, `es`)
- Vite plugin (`@inlang/paraglide-sveltekit/vite`) auto-compiles messages on dev/build
- Generated runtime in `src/lib/paraglide/` (messages.js, runtime.js)
- `src/lib/i18n.ts` — `i18n` instance used by `<ParaglideJS>` root layout wrapper

### Translations
- `messages/en.json` — ~120 English keys (auth, tasks, dashboard, QC, settings, common labels)
- `messages/es.json` — Full Spanish translation of all keys
- Interpolated messages for dynamic values: `level_indicator({ level })`, `bulk_selected({ count })`, `welcome_back({ name })`

### Pages Instrumented
- `src/routes/auth/login/+page.svelte` — all strings including biometric UI
- `src/routes/(app)/tasks/+page.svelte` — board header, stat labels, filter/bulk controls, status names
- `src/lib/components/tasks/TaskCreateModal.svelte` — all form labels and action buttons

### Locale Store (`src/lib/stores/locale.ts`)
- `resolveLocale(userLocale, orgLocale)` — fallback chain: user pref → org default → browser Accept-Language → `'en'`
- `applyLocale(locale)` — calls Paraglide `setLanguageTag()` + persists to `localStorage` (`orbit_locale`)
- `initializeLocale()` — called from app layout after auth loads
- Root layout seeds locale from `localStorage` immediately on mount (for pre-auth pages, no flash)

### Database
- `users.locale` column (text, default `'en'`) — personal language preference
- `organizations.settings.default_locale` (JSONB key) — org-level default

### Settings UI
- Language button-group picker in `/settings` Appearance section — saves to `users.locale` via `usersApi.update()`
- Org default locale selector in `/admin/settings` — saved alongside other org settings

## Theming

### Multi-Theme Support
- **Dracula** dark theme (default dark): vibrant purple/green/cyan accent palette
- **Light** theme: clean default
- **System** theme: follows OS light/dark preference
- Theme picker in `/settings` Appearance section — card-style selector with icon, label, description

### Implementation
- CSS custom properties (`--color-*`) define all color scales in `src/app.css`
- Tailwind config references vars via helper: `rgb(var(--color-*) / <alpha-value>)`
- `:root` block — light mode (standard Tailwind values)
- `.dark` block — Dracula-inspired overrides for all 11 color scales
- `src/lib/stores/theme.ts` — `ThemeName` type: `'light' | 'dracula' | 'system'`
- `theme` store: `setTheme()`, `toggle()`, `cycle()`, `initialize()`
- `isDarkTheme` and `resolvedTheme` derived stores
- `data-theme` attribute on `document.documentElement` for future per-theme CSS overrides
- Theme persisted to `localStorage` under key `orbit_theme`
- Migrates legacy `'dark'` value → `'dracula'` automatically
- Theme dropdown in top bar (header) for quick switching

### Adding New Themes
Future themes (e.g. `midnight`, `solarized`) can be added by:
1. Adding a new entry to `THEMES` array in `theme.ts`
2. Adding a `[data-theme="name"]` CSS block in `app.css`
3. No component changes required — all Tailwind classes resolve via CSS vars

## Production Configuration (2026-04-03 Session)

1. **SMTP** — Supabase Auth custom SMTP configured via management API (`smtp.resend.com:465`, user=`resend`). All email subjects updated to Orbit branding.
2. **Auth email templates** — Orbit-branded HTML for recovery, invite, and email-change pushed via `supabase config push`. Templates live in `supabase/templates/`, referenced from `supabase/config.toml`.
3. **ML API live** — `orbitqcml.onrender.com` returning real confidence breakdowns. `ML_API_URL` + `ML_API_KEY` Supabase secrets set. Edge function redeployed.
4. **DNS** — DKIM already set (`resend._domainkey.owenstuckman.lol`). SPF + DMARC pending (add at Porkbun — see `docs/TODO.md`).

## Bug Fixes (2026-03-31 Session)

1. **Contracts page empty** — `contractsApi.list()` silently returned `[]` when RLS blocked DB records. Fixed by loading contract list from Storage bucket (`contracts/{org_id}/`) and supplementing with DB data. Contracts now always visible if the PDF exists in storage.
2. **`generate-contract` edge function removed** — `contractsApi.create()` was calling a non-existent edge function. Replaced with direct Supabase insert. Client-side jsPDF handles PDF generation and uploads to Storage.
3. **TypeScript error in contracts page** — `downloadPdf(pdfViewerContract!)` non-null assertion inside Svelte event handler caused svelte-check failure. Fixed with explicit null guard.

---

## Bug Fixes (2026-04-14 Session)

1. **Payouts never written to DB** — `payouts` table had no INSERT or UPDATE RLS policies. Every `payoutsApi.create()` call was silently rejected by Postgres; the `.catch()` in `qcApi.create()` swallowed the error. Added `payouts_insert_qc_admin` (INSERT) and `payouts_update_admin` (UPDATE) policies via migration.
2. **DATA_FLOWS.md payout diagram wrong** — doc said `status → paid` immediately after QC approval. Corrected to show the real three-state flow (`pending → approved → paid`) with full status lifecycle table.
3. **Payout creation error swallowing** — Replaced fire-and-forget `.catch()` with `Promise.allSettled()` so both payout creates (task + QC) run in parallel and individual failures are logged with context.

---

## Bug Fixes (2026-03-24 Session)

1. **Edge function feedback format** — Now stores JSON `{summary, confidence_breakdown, issues, recommendations}` instead of plain text, enabling QC page breakdown display
2. **Task status transition** — Edge function updates task to `under_review` after AI review (was staying as `completed`)
3. **Pass number calculation** — `qcApi.submitReview()` excludes AI reviews from count (first human = pass 1, not pass 2)
4. **External submission AI trigger** — `submitExternal()` now calls `qc-ai-review` edge function (was missing)
5. **Edge function name mismatch** — Fixed `'calculate-payout'` → `'payout-calculator'` to match deployed slug
