Current plan, use documenso + stripe to handle all of the payouts and pdfs. Might want to find something better / cheaper than stripe for handling the payments... Maybe if there is a way to just make it a ACH transfer or something like that with no fees.

Considered OpenSeal, and a bunch of other options too.

# Old Notes

main problem to be had is dealing with quality

acceptance ai for checking if tasks are completed correctly / up to criteria, and train off of new quality data 

baiscally need to grind out the full scale concept, then build it all out

gonna need a bunch of algo stuff and figuring out approxes
