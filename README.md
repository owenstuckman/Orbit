# Orbit
The ultimate project management / project payment tool. 


Current plan, use documenso + stripe to handle all of the payouts and pdfs. Might want to find something better / cheaper than stripe for handling the payments... Maybe if there is a way to just make it a ACH transfer or something like that with no fees.

Considered OpenSeal, and a bunch of other options too.


# Notes/ Concepts

Stored in onedrive inside of my obsidian vault. All tagged as #gamified. 

All md documents are stored in there, once built out more will put it inside of here as a wiki.

Will be built into a GH wiki once fleshed out on my personal, just much easier to live edit in obsidian with all the features and everything I like inside of it while I am still solo.
